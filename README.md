# 🍽️ College Mess Food Waste Analysis & Cost Optimization

## 📌 Project Overview
Food wastage in college mess facilities leads to significant financial loss and inefficient use of resources.  
This project analyzes **daily food preparation and consumption data** to identify **food wastage patterns**, estimate **financial losses**, and propose **data-driven optimization strategies** to reduce waste and improve cost efficiency.

The project uses a **realistic synthetic dataset** to simulate real-world mess operations and applies **data analytics techniques** for actionable insights.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze food waste across different meals and food items  
- Identify high-wastage meals and over-prepared food items  
- Estimate financial loss due to food waste  
- Visualize trends for better decision-making  
- Propose data-driven solutions to reduce waste and cost

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset is **synthetically generated** to represent food preparation and consumption in a college mess over **30 days**.

### Dataset Columns:
- Date  
- Meal Type (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)  
- Food Item (Rice, Roti, Dal, Vegetables, Dessert, Snacks)  
- Quantity Prepared (kg)  
- Quantity Consumed (kg)  
- Quantity Wasted (kg)  
- Cost per kg (₹)  
- Total Cost Prepared (₹)  
- Waste Cost (₹)  

✔ Consumption never exceeds preparation  
✔ Waste is logically calculated

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Meal-wise food waste analysis  
- Item-wise food waste analysis  
- Daily food waste trend analysis  
- Financial loss estimation  
- Identification of operational inefficiencies  

---

## 📈 Visualizations
The following visualizations are created using **Matplotlib**:
- Meal-wise food waste bar chart  
- Item-wise food waste bar chart  
- Daily food waste line plot  
- Food item contribution pie chart  

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Identified the **highest wastage meal**
- Determined the **most wasted food item**
- Calculated total food waste (kg)
- Estimated total **financial loss (₹)**
- Identified peak waste days  

---

## ✅ Conclusions & Recommendations
1. Optimize portion sizes for meals with high wastage  
2. Improve preparation strategies for frequently wasted items  
3. Implement food waste tracking systems  
4. Conduct awareness programs for students and staff  
5. Reduce quantities of consistently over-prepared items  
6. Use historical data for demand forecasting  
7. Redesign menus focusing on low-waste items  
8. Donate safe excess food through NGOs  
9. Monitor waste-related financial losses regularly  
10. Reducing food waste also benefits the environment
